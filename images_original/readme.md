## About
This folder stores all of the original images that actually need to be translated.

If you are translating the images, create a copy of this whole folder, then translate all images. That way all images are successfully translated.

Also, if possible, try to keep all original filenames, so that it can be easily replaced. If not possible, then create a simple database with one column the original filenames, and the new filenames in the second column. This is so it can be parsed into the game automatically instead of manually.

## Notes

I am going to categorise all of these images according to a few categories:
* Essential: You will not be able to understand the game without translating these images
* Debug: These are images that have text, but is only used as a placeholder, so can be saved to be translated later
* Supplementary: Things that do not need to be translated to play Min Hero, but still can be shown in-game, so also translate those as well
