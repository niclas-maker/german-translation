## About
This is a repository that holds all of the files and dialogues needed to completely convert the language in Min Hero: Tower of Sages from English to German.

### What's needed:
In order to get a complete translation of Min Hero: Tower of Sages, several things must be changed. These include:
* All dialogue lines
* UI components
This is achieved with online tools and by understanding German (courtesy of Niclas for translations)

## Components
### The dialogues/text
You can access a list of dialogues and text at [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UC8UpDBX27Fy0S1UlSZ4g5U5gFVPKVo0Rv5haw7razo/edit#headingh.u91p25fe0v4c).
### The images
Images are stored in the `images` folder in this repository.

## Tools
Tools used include:
* Pixlr.com -> Used to edit and create images with replaced text

## Creating your own translations
Have a language you want to add into Min Hero? Please follow this guide:
* Create a Github Repository and structure it like this one (`images_original`, `images_in_progress`, `images_done`)
* Copy all of the images in `images_original` : these will be images that you will need to translate for a complete conversion
* Create a copy of the document at [this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UC8UpDBX27Fy0S1UlSZ4g5U5gFVPKVo0Rv5haw7razo/edit#headingh.u91p25fe0v4c), deleting the German side from this document. Also provide a way to access it in the repository you have created (with a link in the `README.md` file, for example)

Once this is set up, have fun translating stuff! To add them into the game, please message square_nine (see below) so I can help you (as it is too long to explain here)

## Contribution
