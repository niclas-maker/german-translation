## About
This is a place to put all of the translated images that are **ready to add to the game**.
This includes the name either **exactly** matching the in-game name (found in "images_original") or with a supplementary database for the names.

## Examples

I already copied over some images to show how to layout this folder.

## Is this necesary?
By having a "in-progress" and a "final" folder, it will be easier to manage what's done and not done, without needing to manage any other documents.
